    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>Christian Mission "New Life" unites people who love God and serve people. The organization's activity is aimed at helping those in need - those who find themselves in a difficult life situation.Mission has existed in Ukraine since 2010. Today
        we are successfully implementing a number of projects - Help to survive, Feed the hungry, Chamber of Mercy, Heating centres. As part of these projects the organization creates points of the collection and distribution of humanitarian aid, heating
        points for the homeless, opens social adaptation and rehabilitation centres, distributes food to the poor, helps in the provision of medical care, etc.The mission began its work in the city of Odessa. Today the organization's activities have
        spread to the whole territory of Ukraine. During 8 years of work 12 branches were established in various cities and towns of the country. More people became volunteers and partners of the mission – there are 5 to 60 volunteers at each branch."New
        Life" collaborates with International Ministry of Charity Emmanuel (IMOCE, Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA Odessa), Global Christian Support (GCS) and others.</p>
    <p>It became possible to embrace even more Ukrainians with care and attention with the support of these missions.Every day people apply to the organization with their problems — they are homeless, co-addicted, socially unprotected categories of the
        population or simply those who have become hostage to circumstances. At the centres they will find a positive response and a desire to help them find a solution to their problems and to build hope for the future, some of them start a new life
        here. After all, the main purpose of the mission is not just to provide one-time assistance but to help those who really want it to break out of the vicious circle and become fully fledged individuals.Christian Mission "New Life" under the motto
        "Love God - Serve people!" continues to grow and gains new dimensions bringing together all those who are not indifferent to the problems of other people and are ready to help their neighbor not by word but by deed.</p>
