            <h3>Change begins with responsibility!</h3>
            <p>We refuse to stay on the side, our responsibility does not end with the threshold of our home. Our home is every street that we walk on, it is each person whom we meet, our home is our city and our country. And we want our home to be clean, so that in our home there would be no starvation, sickness, abandonment and misfortune. No changes in our country can affect our humanity and responsiveness, only we can do this. Please take responsibility for your home.</p>
